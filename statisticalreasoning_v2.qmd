### Q1.1

It looks like size increases with latitude. I'm not confident with it.

### Q1.2

```{r}
pie_crab %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = latitude, y = size)) +
  geom_point() +
  # Make the y-axis include 0
  ylim(0, NA)+
  geom_smooth()
```

### Q1.3

iter=

Number of total iterations per chain (including warmup; defaults to 2000).

```{r}
?brm
```

### Q1.4

I think higher variability would be associated with larger crabs.

### Q1.5

```{r}
pie_crab %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = water_temp_sd, y = size)) +
  geom_point() +
  # Make the y-axis include 0
  ylim(0, NA)+
  geom_smooth()
```

### Q1.6

It looks like size doesn't change with the sd of water temperature. I'm decently confident with it.

### Q1.7
